Yet another live announcement bot

Supports twitch and trovo

run /setup to get started

use /watcher add to add a stream, the platform value is a comma separated list of platforms

use /watcher remove to remove a stream

Hosted privately, If you would like to host your own version you must provide api keys for all of platforms (including discord ofc)

By default the bot adds a delay of 1 to 5 minutes between all of the api calls
